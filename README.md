# nodemaths

At this point this is simply a shell project with test framework boilerplate as well as the ability to jettison the developer if they are not turning manual GC controls on. This is needed to have a proper scientific experiment; a control, something oft omitted in modern 'software engineering'. The tests don't pass, but that's intention: part of TDD. 


Ideally this project goes on to prove that the trivial arithmetic operators in various Node runtimes (this really should auto bootstrap different versions) +, -, * and / are outperformed and equivalent to some voodoo magic combination of bitwise operations.


Pretty positive the [fast inverse square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) proves this.
